# Parsing-Library
A small library to allow me to easily parse almost any file quite easily

This is the first time that I'm using C++, I've learned C for one year now with my school (Epitech) and I think i'm pretty decent at all the basic C stuff.

During this year, we had to do A TON of parsing (file or user input) and so this is why I want to do a very versatile, easy to use and powerfull parsing library.

Why do I not want to use stuff that already exist such as "scanf"? Simple, I want to learn, all the time. I want to know what makes good feature/piece of software, I want to know how to schedule medium/big project, ...

Why C++? Next year I know we will use it and so it has 2 benefits:
First, I'll know some of the basics of C++.
Second, I'll be able to understand more of it, I always think that getting your hand dirty will make you learn more and faster than just doing what is expected from school/boss/...

Well, it's getting more or less a story telling at this point but I really wanted to let people who might see this page know why there is this repo and why the code might not be the best ^^

Later, when there will be more feature, this README will be more what it's expected in a README ^^

Who ever you are, have a good day!
